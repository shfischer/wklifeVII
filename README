This is the source code for the MSE simulations in FLR for WKLIFE VII.

/R/ contains the scripts for creating the OMs and running the MSE simulation
/R/OM1.R creates the stocks from life-history parameters
/R/OM2.R prepares the stocks for the MSE simulations
/R/MP.R is the script for running the actual simulations,
/R/MP_scenarios.R defines the the scenarios for the simulation,
/R/MP_analysis is for analysing the results,
/R/functions/ contains additional functions used in MP.R,
/R/input/ contains the operating model files, load during the simulation,
/R/output/ contains results (stock objects, plots, statistics)
